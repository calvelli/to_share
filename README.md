# to_share
Sharable pieces of code i've made public.

All folders contain some kind of non-obvious solutions to data science problems or useful code for data treatment/analysis that i offen use. Every folder follows the same structure:

## A typical folder
├── subject                     
|   ├── topic
|   |   ├── data        # contains all the data used in the project (not alwyas provided)
|   |   ├── notebooks   # any jupyter notebooks used
|   |   ├── results     # dataframes w/ results and/or plots
|   |   main.py         # proper implemented code and any other useful scripts
|   |   requirements.txt
├── subject_2
|   ├── topic
├── ...
└── README.md

I dont intend to maintain anything here
